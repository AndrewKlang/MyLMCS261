# Scratch
- In my process of playing around with Scratch, I had an idea I wanted to start with.
- So my idea was to first figure out how to move sprites.
- Once I figured out how to get sprites to move with certain blocks, I started adding more sprites.
- My next step was to figure out how to make certain events trigger other events.
- After much trail and error, I learned how to make backgrounds trigger sounds, sounds trigger movements, and such to trigger other loops.
- With this knowledge I added custom sounds and backgrounds that can be activated by doing certain movements within the game!
- The only thing that really confused me and that I couldn't really figure out was how to fully reset the game after doing different events without just refreshing the page.
