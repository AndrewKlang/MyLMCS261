 What Is Code
 - A computer is a clock with benefits.
 - You can do anything a computer can with pen and paper, however a computer can do it billions of times per second.

 How Do You Type an "A"
 - The keyboard is waiting for you to press a key, or release one; it’s constantly scanning to see what keys are pressed down. Hitting the key sends a scancode.
- Coders are people who are willing to work backward to that key press.

From Hardware to Software
- Microsoft used to run everything.
- Coders, starting with concepts such as “signals from a keyboard” and “numbers in memory,” created infinitely reproducible units of digital execution that we call software, hoping to meet the needs of the marketplace.
    - If coders don’t run the world, they run the things that run the world.
- Software is there when you switch channels and your cable box shows you what else is on. It's everywhere.

How Does Code Become Software
- Code - A sequence of symbols (using typical keyboard characters, saved to a file of some kind) that someone typed in, or copied, or pasted from elsewhere.
- Computers usually “understand” things by going character by character, bit by bit, transforming the code into other kinds of code as they go.
- The process of going character by character can be wrapped up into a routine—also called a function, a method, a subroutine, or component.

What Is An Algorithm
- An algorithm solves a problem.
- A programming language is a system for encoding, naming, and organizing algorithms for reuse and application.
- “Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.”
- The hardest work in programming is getting around things that aren’t computable
- The average programmer is moderately diligent, capable of basic mathematics, has a working knowledge of one or more programming languages, and can communicate what he or she is doing to management and his or her peers.
