# Pyramid
Starting off the Pyramid
- My first approach to figuring out the pyramid was starting with for loops.
  - This approach gave me a bit of progress by using this line of code to create
    8 #'s in a line.
    - for x in range(8):
	       print("#")
  - To try to go off of this, I used this code to make a box
    - for x in range(stack):
        for y in range(stack):
          print('#', end='')
            print()
- However after this point is where I started to hit a wall.
  - I played around with adding a - to the stacks or parts of the function and
    would either get syntax errors or get 40 #'s in a row.
- After this I started from scratch and tried to go step by step direction wise.
- To complete the first step asked I put down this
  - stack = int(input("how tall should the pyramid be from 1 to 8: "))
- To complete the second step I wrote this
  - if stack > 8:
	   print("event failed, exit program")
  - However I still never figured out how to fully make the pyramid using the
    stack method being asked.
  - I did however look up a video on looping in python and created this solution
    which makes the pyramid. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnDr4J2UXSA
    - a = ["       #", "      ##", "     ###", "    ####", "   #####",
      "  ######", " #######", "########"]
      >>> for stack in a:
	       print(stack)
    - which although I know this isn't the way you wanted to get the pyramid,
      I wanted to at least find one way to do it, because after staring and
      typing in idle for a few hours I just couldn't figure out that last piece
      I was missing.
    - I would string together for statements, however they never work the way I
      wanted them too.
      - I feel like it's something that will click with next class when we go
        over how people solved it, and if not I'll just go to your next office
        hour!
