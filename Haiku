# Making the Haiku
- In my process of recording the Haiku, I didn't run into many issues.
  - One thing that I did run into however was accidentally setting everything to say in terminal.
    - To fix it I just restarted terminal
  - So after I figured it out I got a haiku from online, used the template you gave on git and recorded it to my desktop.
