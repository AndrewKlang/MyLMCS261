HTML Assignment
- https://nbellini.github.io
- There were a few problems we ran into while doing the assignment.
  - The first small issue was that Raja and I were not able to attend last class, so we
    didn't really know how to approach HTML at first, but after a bit of explaining from
    Chris and Nikki we started to get the hang of it quickly and we went to work!
  - The second issue we ran into was pulling items from branches to the main.
    - This happened when I tried pushing the audio from my branch to the main, however
      after a bit of troubleshooting we figured it out, which helped ease the rest of
      our pulling to main processes.
      - Also little side note, if you haven't clicked on the audio on the website yet,
        I would advice you to turn your volume down a bunch, because it is very loud...
        - Also I apologize in advance if you are reading this after the fact.
  - The third issue we ran into was of getting the information in the main to our individual
    branches.
    - We solved this issue by comparing and pulling our branches to the main.
  - The last big problem we ran into was how were we going to each edit our sections
    without messing with anyone else's edits.
    - We solved this by taking editing it one at a time and then pulling the edit to main,
      then repeating the process until we have all edited our individual parts.
- I contributed to the group in a few different ways.
  - The first way was finding and sending the audio we all agreed on adding to the website.
  - The second way was test running and using trial and error with Nikki to figure out how
    pulling items from our individual branches to the main would work out. Which we figured
    out and in term helped the process go much smoother for the rest of us.
  - I also may have been a catalyst for the meme style bandmate descriptions...
  - I also contributed my edits onto the website as well as for the most part being the
    first person to test out different situations so that the next edits would go smoother.
- The members in my group all contributed in a multitude of different ways.
  - Nikki did most of the main directory admin work.
  - Chris helped out a lot with the troubleshooting stages.
  - Raja helped a lot with idea making for the website.
  - In all it was a great experience and helped me learn a lot!
