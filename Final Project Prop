Final Project Proposal
1. For my final project I would like to do a professional website for myself.
2. This project I feel will help me fully master HTML, which I would love to learn and master! Also
   I specifically wanted to choose this project because I am taking another class this semester in
   which I am required to make a website for myself using wix, and after hearing your opinion on wix
   in class I wanted to truly test the difference between the two!
3. I will use the resources we will learn in class about HTML in the upcoming weeks, as well as any
   online source that could help out. Most likely from sources like stack overflow.
4. This will be a central hub for myself as well as my audiences on various social platforms about my
   artistry.
5. My timeline will mostly be in line with what we learn with HTML. I will try to use what we will be
   learning in each class to pace myself so that I will be able to do this in increments, instead of
   rushing something at the end. I will try to do pieces of it every week this way, and hopefully have
   a rough draft of the website as a whole the week we finish HTML.
6. I believe I should be assessed by how much more advanced and intuitive my website will be to it's wix
   counterpart. I believe that if in the end I was only able to do what I could do in wix, then I have
   truly not done my final project justice.
