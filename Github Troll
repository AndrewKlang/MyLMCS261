GitHub Troll
- The project that I watched for a week was a project that did a bunch of things with meme templates in python.
  - I picked this one because it was interesting, however it was also more active than all the other projects I
    was going to use.
- One of the changes I found that was cool, was the amount of new templates that were added every few days.
  - This was honestly one of the only consistent changes throughout the week, with everything else kind of
    staying the same
- The other two changes we're similar in nature, in which they were just tiny text edits in their python files,
  just to make everything run smoother.
  - This usually happened every time a new template was added and tiny edits the days afterwards.
- There wasn't a crazy amount of comments for each edit, however I found one from 10 days ago that showed how they
  fixed a problem where the backgrounds were not becoming transparent.
- When it came to the editing section of the project and the changes, it wasn't very communicative, however when it
  comes to how you use the code, they have a really detailed step by step process on everything, which was pleasant
to look at.
