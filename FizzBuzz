# FizzBuzz
Starting off the code
- To start off I first tried experimenting with different formulas given in class.
- I tried using the formula down below to count, however after editing and trial and error
  it always started on the number I put in and added the same number, which was not going
  to work
  - def func(count):
    for i in range(count + 1):
    print(f"{count - i} Lovely!")
- After a while of trial and error, I used the code that I found in a video to count up too
  100
  - >>> number = 1
    >>> while number < 101:
	       print(number)
	       number = number + 1
- This was a huge breakthrough because after that I added if statements and got the
  fizzes and buzzes to print where they were supposed too
  - while number < 101:
	     print(number)
	     number = number + 1
	     if (number % 3 == 0):
		     print("fizz")
		     if (number % 5 == 0):
			      print("Buzz")
			      if (number % 3,5 == 0):
				        print("FizzBuzz")
- This almost worked, however the Fizz and Buzzes were only added and did not replace the
  numbers
  - As a result I tried many different things, adding in subtractions to the code, however
    nothing really worked so I texted Nikki if she could look at my code and help me out!
- She gave me the idea to put the print(number) at the end and make it an else statement,
  and with a bit of tweaking it worked like a charm!
- My final result
  - >>> number = 0
    >>> while number < 100:
	      number = number + 1
	      if (number % 3 == 0):
		       print("fizz")
		       if (number % 5 == 0):
			       print("Buzz")
			       if (number % 3,5 == 0):
				         print("FizzBuzz")
	      else:
		      print(f"{number}")
