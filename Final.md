# Final Project
- For my final project I made a professional website for myself!
  - To start the project I first launched my website through github pages, as was shown in the examples
    you gave!
  - After a little bit of time with fooling around I finally got my website to be up and running.
    - Also it did help learning that you probably shouldn't rename an index.html file something else...
      (yeah pages really didn't like that XD)
  - But after I learned from my prior mistakes and got my site up and running, it was time to figure out
    what I want my website to look like.
    - This took me to the links to the many template websites you gave us a few weeks prior.
  - While looking at the templates I found one that I kind of liked, so I downloaded it and gave it a test
    run.
    - To do this I first tried coping and pasting the text from the index.html file to my existing html file,
      which as I stated before, was not named index.html.
      - This was flustering me a little bit, cause I had no clue what to do, so afterwards I decided to just
        drag and drop the downloaded html file to my atom.
        - And surprise surprise, the file named index.html worked flawlessly.
    - After that little bump, I started to drag everything in, replacing the files I had existing for my project
      and started to really get somewhere.
      - When my first template worked, I tried one after another, just kind of messing around with designs I liked.
    - I then stumbled upon the current one I decided to use and stick with.
      - https://html5up.net/big-picture
    - After this worked, I started searching through the .html file to see where and how I should edit it to fit my
      liking.
      - This brought me to really learning how to edit on html (which I am still learning a lot on)
    - I then wrote through a bunch of drafts for different bios and paragraphs to add to my website, as well as
      editing certain labels that was on the original template to fit more towards my design.
    - The next challenge was to add my own pictures within the project.
      - I started by trying to add a moving mp4 image of myself playing guitar for when you enter the page.
      - This very much did not work, so I tried a .gif instead.
        - Which also, with my attempt of editing the html and css, did not work.
      - So afterwards I decided to try a normal picture instead.
        - Which weirdly enough worked everywhere except for the starting slide. And to be completely honest I
          still have no idea why.
      - And this is where a lot, and still ongoing, trial and error is happening within my project.
        - I first read through every line of code looking to see if I may be missing something or may have
          deleted something within my edits.
          - I did see anything, so I tried plugging back in the original image that came with the template to see
            if it worked. Trying to back trace my steps.
            - And sadly it didn't
          - So after hours of me trying to figure out why this one image isn't working, I decided that maybe I
            either deleted something when I was editing text or messed up with the original code when I was messing
            with mp4s and gifs. So I redownloaded the original template and started from scratch.
          - This ended in the same result, so I decided instead to try to manually write out a code to insert the image.
          - This "added" in the image, however it popped up as a missing jpg instead of my actual image.
            - This was also extremely confusing to me, because on my index.html file the image is there, so I have no
              idea why this is happening.
          - Nevertheless, I started working on a different aspect of the project, aka adding a video hyperlink to my
            pictures in the work tab.
            - I was able to do this by editing the pre-written code to fit a video link, instead of what was originally there.
          - I originally though this wasn't working, because I was trying to use tiktok links, however I soon came to learn
            that youtube links worked much more smoothly for what I was trying to implement.
            - So I uploaded the videos I had on tiktok to youtube, and used the links that way.
              - Which made the product just the way I wanted it.
              - I will try to implement the ideas I received in class for making the photo hyperlinks more noticeable, by
                figuring out how to make the photos expand when you hover over them.
                - I will also figure out a way to delete the little underbar that pops up when you click on them.
            - And honestly besides my continual struggle with the intro image, everything came out the way I wanted it to,
              with still a bunch of tweaking to do!
